Favorites enhancements is a favorites panel for Unity3D to list all your favorites assets or scene gameobjects in your project, which can significantly simplify the development process.

The following gif shows the quick selection of players' left and right hands(so that you can easily put weapons and items into the hands.) You can drag objects from the Hierarchy or Project into this panel.
